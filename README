Game-OF-33

The player and the dealer can have up to 9 cards.

The player is allowed to hit cards to have a score of 33 or  nearest to 33 with a max of 9 cards.

The player has the option to swap a card . If you swap a card it runs the value from (+) to (-).

When the player hits the stay button  then the dealer gets to play.

While the dealer count is <9 and his score is < 33 then dealer plays.

When the dealer is done playing then the result message will be posted.

Whoever has the closest distance to 33 wins. If the dealer's distance > the player, the player wins. But if the dealer's distance <  the player , the dealer wins.
In the event of negative  numbers(-) (e.g.- a score of 40 ,so 33 - 40= -7),we will negate it to flip it to positive numbers(+).
If the dealer and the player has the same distance then its a tie. Tie score will work across  positive(+) and negative(-) results for as long as they have the same distance (e.g.-player has 32, dealer has 34- it's still a tie).
